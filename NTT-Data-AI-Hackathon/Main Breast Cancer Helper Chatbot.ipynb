      "HelperBot: A disease in which abnormal cells divide uncontrollably and destroy body tissue. Some genetic changes cause cells to divide uncontrollably and provides ability to the cells to spread to other locations and destroys them. Exact cause of Breast Cancer is not known, but having family history, obesity, Age, Reproductive history, BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutation are considered some of the risk factors\n",
      "\n",
      "Me:what is a biopsy\n",
      "HelperBot: A biopsy is a procedure to remove a piece of tissue or a sample of cells from your body so that it can be tested in a laboratory. In Aspiration biopsy a syringe is inserted to draw out some cells and those cells are checked under microscope. In USG guided biopsy an ultrasonography machine is used to check the tumor and a needle is inserted to draw some pieces of tumor to analyse under microscope. Biopsy is perfpormed under local anesthesia hence it is not painful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Me:what are the types of breast cancer\n",
      "HelperBot: There are multiple types of Breast Cancers:\n",
      "1.Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS): Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS; also known as intraductal carcinoma) is a non-invasive or pre-invasive breast cancer.\n",
      "2.Invasive breast cancer (ILC or IDC): Invasive (or infiltrating) breast cancer has spread into surrounding breast tissue. The most common types are invasive ductal carcinoma and invasive lobular carcinoma. Invasive ductal carcinoma makes up about 70-80% of all breast cancers.\n",
      "3.Triple-negative breast cancer: Triple-negative breast cancer is an aggressive type of invasive breast cancer in which the cancer cells donâ€™t have estrogen or progesterone receptors (ER or PR) and also donâ€™t make any or too much of the protein called HER2. (The cells test 'negative' on all 3 tests.) It accounts for about 15% of all breast cancers and can be a difficult cancer to treat.\n",
      "Inflammatory breast cancer: Inflammatory breast cancer is an aggressive type of invasive breast cancer in which cancer cells block lymph vessels in the skin, causing the breast to look 'inflamed.' It is rare and accounts for about 1% to 5% of all breast cancers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Me:what exactly is DCIS\n",
      "HelperBot: Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is the presence of abnormal cells inside a milk duct in the breast. DCIS is considered the earliest form of breast cancer. DCIS is non-invasive, meaning it hasn't spread out of the milk duct.  However, the cells can become invasive in due time can spread to other organs. Hence It should be treated by consulting an Oncologist/OncoSurgen. The positive news is that if you have only DCIS without Invasive component, the 10-year survival rate is 98%, however if you are dragonized with DCIS, you will need frequent monitoring even after treatment as your risk of cancer increases if you had DCIS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Me:What is ER positive cancer\n",
      "HelperBot: Cancer cells can have hormone receptors, that is hormones might fuel the growth of cancer cells, if there are Estrogen hormone receptor they are called ER Positive Cancers, if there are Progesterone hormone receptors they are called PR positive cancer, There are more treatment options available or ER/PR positive cancer and because of this these types of cancer have better prognosis when compared to ER/PR negative cancers as ER/PR negative lack the hormone receptors medicine like hormone inhabitors cannot be used for hormone negative cancers\n",
      "\n",
      "Me:what are the treatments available\n",
      "HelperBot: Surgery is the main form of treatment, if there is not much spread of cancer in body, Surgery will be done first (Mastectomy or Lumpectomy) \f",
      "ollowed by Chemotherapy and Radiation. Sometimes chemo and Radiation will be given together. Sometimes Radiation may not be given depending on age and type of cancer. In case of advance or stage 4 cases, Chemo is usually recommending before surgery. Duration of treatment depends on type and spread of cancer, for stage 4 cancer the treatment is usually lifelong. Immunotherapy is a newer form of treatment mostly used to treat advance cancer.\n",
