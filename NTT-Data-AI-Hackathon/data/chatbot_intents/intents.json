A tumor can be benign or cancerous (malignant), A benign tumor has distinct, smooth, regular borders. A malignant tumor has irregular borders and grows faster than a benign tumor. \n A malignant tumor can also spread to other parts of your body.

DCIS is noninvasive, meaning it hasn't spread out of the milk duct.  However the cells can bcome invasive in due time can spread to other organs. Hence It should be treated by consulting a Oncologist/OncoSurgen. The positive news is that if you have only DCIS without Invasive componenet, the 10 year survival rate is 98%, however if you are diagonized  with DCIS, you will need fequent monitoring  even after treatment as your risk of cancer increases if you had DCIS."]
