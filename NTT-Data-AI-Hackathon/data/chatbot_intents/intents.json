A tumor can be benign or cancerous (malignant), A benign tumor has distinct, smooth, regular borders. A malignant tumor has irregular borders and grows faster than a benign tumor. \n A malignant tumor can also spread to other parts of your body. A benign tumor can become quite large, but it will not invade nearby tissue or spread to other parts of your body."]

DCIS is non-invasive, meaning it hasn't spread out of the milk duct.  However, the cells can become invasive in due time can spread to other organs. Hence It should be treated by consulting an Oncologist/OncoSurgen. The positive news is that if you have only DCIS without Invasive component, the 10-year survival rate is 98%, however if you are dragonized with DCIS, you will need frequent monitoring even after treatment as your risk of cancer increases if you had DCIS."]

Sometimes chemo and Radiation will be given together. Sometimes Radiation may not be given depending on age and type of cancer. In case of advance or stage 4 cases, Chemo is usually recommending before surgery. Duration of treatment depends on type and spread of cancer, for stage 4 cancer the treatment is usually lifelong.

The most common types are invasive ductal carcinoma and invasive lobular carcinoma. Invasive ductal carcinoma makes up about 70-80% of all breast cancers.\n3.Triple-negative breast cancer: Triple-negative breast cancer is an aggressive type of invasive breast cancer in which the cancer cells don’t have estrogen or progesterone receptors (ER or PR) and also don’t make any or too much of the protein called HER2. (The cells test 'negative' on all 3 tests.) It accounts for about 15% of all breast cancers and can be a difficult cancer to treat.\nInflammatory breast cancer: Inflammatory breast cancer is an aggressive type of invasive breast cancer in which cancer cells block lymph vessels in the skin, causing the breast to look 'inflamed.' It is rare and accounts for about 1% to 5% of all breast cancers."]
